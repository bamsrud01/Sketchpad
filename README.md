# Sketchpad

This project is the second major project in The Odin Project.  It is a sketchpad that responds when the mouse is passed over it.  This was an early project of mine, written when I first learned JavaScript and jQuery.

## Features

- The board is automatically set to a 16x16 grid when the page loads.
- The board size can be changed with a button click.
- The sketchpad includes a variety of modes:
  - Sketch in solid red or blue
  - Sketch in random color
  - Sketch a trail that fades in a set interval
  - Sketch to reduce opacity in a board of solid red or blue
